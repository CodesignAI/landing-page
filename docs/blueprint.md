# **App Name**: CoDesignAI

## Core Features:

- Automated Analog Optimization: Automate complex analog optimization processes using AI algorithms.
- Smart Experimentation: Run thousands of smart experiments to find the best design parameters.
- Silicon-Ready Results: Deliver silicon-ready results in hours instead of months, drastically reducing development time.
- Product Information: Provide a section to explain the product capabilities with a succinct listing of information that the company wants the customer to know about.
- Pricing Section: A section on the website with all the price plans that can be accessed with proper credentials and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Contact Form: Implement a contact form for users to book a demo or get in touch with the team. Collect their contact information (like name, email, company and the message), validate these, and send the information over to the company for further handling of leads. Consider that some users would also want to email directly rather than use a form, so be sure to add the support email.
